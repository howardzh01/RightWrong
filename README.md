Inspired by Card's Against Humanities, this multiplayer party game starts with a judge writing the beginning of a sentence so that players can complete it. Make sure the answers are funny, wacky, and wrong?! The judge picks which sentence is most entertaining and the player who wrote it recieves a point. The player with the most points wins the game!
